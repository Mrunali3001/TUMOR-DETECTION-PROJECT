# TUMOR-DETECTION-PROJECT

This project will test your ability to handle medical datasets, perform preprocessing, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
and apply machine learning models using Python in Jupyter Notebook. You will work with a Tumor_Detection dataset containing features related to tumor characteristics 
(mean radius, texture, perimeter, etc.) and labels indicating whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B). The objective is to classify tumors using a machine learning model and visualize patterns in the data.
